## Overview

This GitHub repository showcases my work for ITAI 2376, including assignments, presentations, and projects across modules covering foundational and advanced AI concepts such as:

- Neural Networks & CNNs  
- NLP & Sequence Modeling  
- Transformers, VAEs, GANs  
- Diffusion Models  
- AI Agents, Reasoning & Multi-Agent Systems

---


##  Highlights

###  Teaching AI to Kids (Module 4)
- Translated deep learning into simple visuals for an 11-year-old audience  
- Built slides showing CNNs using cookies and robots  

### NLP & Arrival (Module 5)
- Analyzed *Arrival* to explore how AI models human-alien communication  
- Connected RNNs and language prediction tasks  

### Midterm – Diffusion Model (Module 9)
- Trained a generative U-Net on CIFAR-10  
- Generated synthetic image samples  

###  Capstone – AI Agent System (Modules 10–14)
- Implementing goal-based agents using RL and planning  
- Inspired by LLM orchestration, RAG, AutoGen, and memory-based reasoning
